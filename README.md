# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Overview

This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. Leveraging Scikit-Learn for model building and pandas for data manipulation, the project uses a Kaggle dataset to train and evaluate fraud detection models. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions based on features extracted from transaction data.
## Features

* Load and preprocess credit card transaction data from a Kaggle dataset
* Train and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection
* Use Scikit-Learn to implement classification algorithms
* Analyze model performance with metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score
* Visualize model results and feature importance

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fraud_detection_analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

        cd Fraud_detection_analysis

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

          python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:

        Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

        MacOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

5. Install the required packages:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data

* Dataset: The project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. Download the dataset and place it in the data directory as credit_card_fraud.csv.

## Results

* Model Performance: Metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to evaluate model accuracy in detecting fraud.
* Visualizations: Plots showing model performance and feature importance to understand how different features impact fraud detection.
